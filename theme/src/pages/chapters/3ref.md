[^3]:  Among the many after-dinner tales J.B. related was one that he claimed affected his ability to establish a career in Germany. He

implied that he was unable to secure a steady job that offered advancement because of the Kaiser’s army’s policies requiring constant

and frequently unexpected call up of the reserves. He would claim that these untimely and unpredictable training demands interfered

with pursuing a career in accounting.

band of his hat, his standing collar, and the Brandenburg cuff were red. Gold lace trimmed the collar and cuff. Joseph is a N. C. O.

armbands, and helmet plates. Photo is in the collection of Mark B. Wieser – Fredericksburg, Texas. -

[^6]:  The 101st Infantry Division served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. It crossed the Dnestr in June 1915, participated in the battles on the Galician and Russian Poland border, and advanced to the Bug by August. The division was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. It reached Priština in late November and advanced to the Greek border in December. For most of 1916 and into 1917, the division remained on the Macedonian front. It underwent several changes, losing units to other divisions and receiving various replacements, and in July 1917, the division was dissolved as a tactical headquarters, with its subunits sent to other units. Its headquarters remained as a division staff for special purposes, administering Bulgarian units, until it was dissolved. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Infantry_Division_ (German_Empire) – accessed June 5, 2010.

[^7]: Der Struwwelpeter  is a popular German children’s book by Heinrich Hoffmann. It comprises ten illustrated and rhymed stories,

mostly about children. Each has a clear moral that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior in an exaggerated way.

[^8]: Weingarten  is a town with a population of 24,000 (as of 2005) in Württemberg, in the District of Ravensburg, in the valley of the

Schussen River. Together with the southern neighboring cities of Ravensburg and Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, it forms one

of 14 medium-sized infrastructural centers in Baden-Württemberg. During the 19th century several barracks were placed in Altdorf-

Weingarten, making the city an important military site. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weingarten_(W%C3%BCrttemberg) –

the middle of a city.

[^10]:  Postcards were as popular in Europe as they were in the United States. A divided back was first allowed in Germany in 1907 and

ushered in the “Golden Age” of postcards as millions were sold and used. European card publishers accounted for over 75% of all

postcards sold in the United States that year. Germany’s printing methods were the best in the world and exhibited the brightest

colors and the finest artwork. Joseph bought many postcards from places that he visited. He never owned a camera and so his

collection served as his photo album. He kept a large stack of them in his Kleiderschrank in his bedroom and apparently took them

out from time to time to reminisce. - The History of Postcards - http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/historyofpostcards.htm -

[^13]: The 101st Bavarian Infantry  – It is difficult to find exact information on this unit. In 1914 Germany was recognized as having the

most efficient army in the world. Its structure included universal mass conscriptions for short-term military service followed by a

longer period in reserve. The German Army placed great emphasis on high quality training and maintaining a large number of

experienced senior officers. The German Army in 1914 comprised 25 corps (700,000 men). - accessed May 22, 2010.

[^14]:  The military barracks in Constance was named for Frederick III, the German Kaiser that followed his father Kaiser Wilhelm I to

the throne in 1888, the year Joseph was born. However, he was dying of cancer at the time and lived to rule for barely three months.

He had married the daughter of Queen Victoria, and their son became Kaiser Wilhelm II. Consequently 1888 was the year of three

Kings. – Frederick III, German Emperor - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III,_German_Emperor – accessed June.

Christmas.

[^18]:  In correspondence with Klaus-Peter Bitzer, Langenargen, Germany, no record could be found of Joseph having been in the army,

at least not from Langenargen. The absence of his name there indicates that he had completed his obligation to the army at some

point before gaining employment there in August 1908. Correspondence – Files of M. Wieser, File 127.

beauty of landscapes created by nature. In later years his thoughts must have wandered back to these times along the shores of Lake

Konstance and brought back good memories.
