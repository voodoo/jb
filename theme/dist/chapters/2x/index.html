<h1 id="uncle-vincents-triumphant-homecoming">Uncle Vincent’s Triumphant Homecoming</h1>
<p>In 1910 a letter arrived at the Gasthaus zum Löwen in Volkertshausen, perhaps delivered by the postmaster, for it could not have
been addressed to Wendelin. Wendelin only had the inn for a year. It had been very likely simply addressed to the mayor hoping that
he would deliver it to anyone named Wieser. Upon opening, it revealed that some relative in America was seeking to make contact
with long lost relatives in Volkertshausen. Wendelin Wieser learned that he was going to be receiving a visitor from America, a first cousin whom he had never met, for his father’s brother had taken his entire family to America in the mid-1800s, some 50 years
before. If Wendelin’s father had mentioned an existence of a long lost brother, we again will never know. Wendelin had not even
been born when his uncle decided to flee the Hegau to try his luck in America. Nor do we know what Wendelin’s dad might have
told him about having a brother who had immigrated to America. His immigration might have been met with resentment in that he
was able to leave and his dad had to stay. Wendelin, however, was obviously pleased, for it would give him an opportunity to show
off if that even mattered to him. Also, Joseph could come home from Lake Constance as well to meet his long lost cousin. Vincent
Wieser, however, was returning for purely nostalgic reasons, and it is very doubtful that he was intending to renew acquaintances. He had been born there many years before. His children seemed to care less about their roots and none, not even Vincent’s wife, wished to return to Germany. Now, in his seventies and knowingly growing weaker, he wanted to see his birthplace one more time before his days on earth were over.</p>
<p>Vincent’s pilgrimage would change the lives of two of his German cousins in ways he could never have fathomed or
intended. Vincent, living in America since 1856, had accompanied his family at the age of 19 as an immigrant to the United States.
There in the North, the family lived throughout the Civil War. With hard work and determination, Vincent became a very successful
businessman, a multi-millionaire who truly had experienced the American dream.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Now at the age of 73, he sought to make a final
pilgrimage to the village of his birth. As he posed for a souvenir ship’s photograph, he stared ahead with his steely, determined eyes focused toward the east, wondering how his village may have changed in the six decades since he had left. At that time his
principality of Baden was not even part of the new Germany. Now Germany was unified by a single king and as an economic power
was ranked the number one industrial nation on earth. Just once more, he thought if he could visit the places, the memories of which
were faintly kept only in his mind, his life would be complete, and he could die in peace a happy and contented man.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Vincent’s success in America, as many others who had preceded him, set an example of the rewards that awaited those who
worked hard in America. Individual effort and the freedom to work in jobs unavailable and unthinkable to average Europeans could
result in an opportunity to attain financial gain. That kind of opportunity for success appealed directly to Joseph who already firmly
believed that hard work coupled with a sound education could lead to his eventual success. Ernst, Joseph’s younger brother, being
only nine at the time, was still too young to understand or even care about such opportunities, and that was quite natural and normal,
for what nine-year-old would have given immigration much thought at that age? Anna was expecting some rich gifts of chocolates or
other exiting things from their American cousin. Little did Vincent suspect that he was having such a profound impact on their lives.
Little did Anna realize that their American cousin would only bring them rosaries. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Vincent embarked for the United States with a fixed intention of becoming a citizen of a freer and better country than his
native land. His parents had first chosen to settle in Williamsport, Indiana in 1856 and there put down roots. As the frontier moved ever farther westward, so did Vincent’s family, finally settling in Iowa.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> Rushing to the bedside of a stricken son in Texas, he
discovered great opportunities there and in 1889, at an age when most men would be content to live out their lives in the community
they have called home, Vincent moved his family to Texas, that state barely approaching its first half-century as a member of the
American union.</p>
<p>Vincent Wieser, a flour miller by profession, allegedly was so impressed with the mildness of the climate and friendliness of
the people that he resolved to make it his home. He moved the balance of his nine children to Texas (the one who allegedly was ill
was also named Joseph, but why he was in Texas remains unknown) and purchased an existing gristmill and cotton gin in 1891. The
mill in Hico <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> was quite profitable and soon other milling properties in the Central Texas area were purchased by him and his sons. These included the Dublin Flour Mill and Elevator Company, the Munday Mill and Elevator Company, Stanford Mill and Elevator
Company, Hamilton Mill and Elevator Company, Grain and Elevator Company at Iredell, J. F. Wieser &amp; Co., Inc., Hico Roller Mills,
Waco Mill &amp; Elevator Company, the Texas Company, and in other Texas locations, including Fort Worth and Cisco. The Hamilton
Mill and Elevator Company also owned the Hamilton Light &amp; Power Company, The Dublin Power and Light Company, Inc., and
the Hico Electric Light and Power Company were also owned in the partnership with his sons, a partnership that lasted until his
death in 1916. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, Vincent installed the first telephone system at Hico, which was extended to Hamilton by the purchase of
existing telegraph lines. Telephone service was also extended to the neighboring towns of Carlton, Iredell, and Walnut Springs. The
Electric Company was eventually incorporated under the title of Central Texas Power and Transmission Company. His investment
and interests in various banking concerns created the Hico National Bank. In addition, he also established Hico Ice and Cold Storage
Co. and Hico Cotton Compress. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup> Vincent had done very well in America!</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Germany, Vincent wasted no time in Hamburg. He was on a mission and took immediate steps to secure
travel south to Stuttgart by rail and farther south to Tuttlingen and then finally to the village of his birth by carriage. In
Volkertshausen, Vincent made inquires and soon visited with his long forgotten family members and with their help, identified the
descendants of those his family had left behind many decades before. The experience was undoubtedly not unlike that which was
experienced five decades later when Joseph’s family arrived to be introduced to their cousins. It was one of pure unadulterated joy!
The smiles radiating in the faces of those who remained in Germany cannot be forgotten, for their joy was clearly packed with an
overwhelming emotion and with such warmth that visitors felt an instant sense of belonging. It was a true reunion! The wine was
brought out of their cellar and the table covered with their finest linens and set with their best bone china. Heaped on the table were a variety of breads and cheeses and farm-made sausages that put anything available in America to shame. It was as if they dined this way each and every day. It was a Kaffeeklatsch <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup> not to be forgotten! Coffee was brewed to perfection in the most simplistic manner, the aroma of which radiated along with the warmth of the emotions being generated in the room. Dessert, perhaps a stone-in cherry pie, was generously offered to those who had returned. One dared not refuse any offering for fear of giving offense. Maria certainly put forth her best efforts to make Wendelin’s American cousin feel at home. Then, as things settled down, one saw in their eyes the
great anticipation of hearing and learning of what life was like in America.</p>

<p>Vincent took a room at the <em>Gasthaus zum Löwen</em> where he met the owner, his first cousin, for the very first time. Wendelin
was Vincent’s father’s nephew, who had not yet been born when Vincent’s father moved his family to America. Vincent would note
in his diary that he was not impressed with Wendelin. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Hico</strong> is located in North Central Texas at the junction of U.S. Highway 281 and State Highways 6 and 220, in northeastern
Hamilton County. A post office was first established in 1860. By 1874, the town had eight businesses, including a cotton gin, although most residents raised cattle and horses. Construction of the Texas Central Railroad in 1880 prompted its citizens to move the hamlet 2½ miles to the line. Hico was incorporated in 1883 and became the county’s shipping center. The population was 1,480 in 1890 when a fire destroyed business houses on the east side of Pecan Street. A few weeks later, another fire ravaged the west side.
Rebuilding in stone ended the fire menace, but periodic overflows of the Bosque River have remained a threat to low-lying areas.
Over the years, Hico has prospered as cotton and cattle market center. In 1940, although its population had declined to 1,242, the
town was incorporated and had a post office, a bank, and fifty businesses, but the Wieser mills had been moved, first to Hamilton,
and finally to Lampasas. Hico continued to decline and had a population low of 925 in 1970, but it is slowly rebounding. <em>Handbook of Texas Online</em> , s.v. ”,” <a href="http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/hjh8.html">http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/hjh8.html</a> - accessed September 14, 2008. <a href="#user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-backref="" class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
